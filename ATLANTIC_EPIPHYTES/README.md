### ***ATLANTIC-EPIPHYTES A DATASET OF HOLO/HEMIEPIPHYES SPECIES FROM THE ATLANTIC FOREST OF WOUTH AMERICA***

RAMOS  et al. in prep to be submitted to ECOLOGY journal, April 2018

Here, we compiled a dataset of 85000 georeferenced locations of XXX SPECIES. 

For the epiphytes records, the most abundant species were XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX and XXX.  The Angiosperms group represented X% of the records, followed by Ferns (X e %), Lycophyte (X e %), Lichens (X e %), Fungi (X e %) and Mosses (X e %). In Angiosperms the most representative families were Bromeliaceae (X e %), Orchidaceae (X e %), Piperaceae (X e %) and Cactaceae (X e %). Within Bromeliaceae the main generas were XXXX (X e %), XXXX (X e %) and XXXX (X e %). In Orchidaceae the principal were  XXXX (X e %), XXXX (X e %) and XXXX (X e %)(X e %). The dominance was low in the Ferns group with XXXX (X e %), XXXX (X e %) and XXXX (X e %) followed by Lycophyte with XXXX (X e %), XXXX (X e %) and XXXX (X e %). In Lichens, Fungi and Mosses groups, the most dominants families were XXX, XXX, XXX, and XXX.

ATLANTIC-PRIMATES dataset is part of the ATLANTIC SERIES, on which research teams are compiling biodiversity information of  Atlantic Forest biome. 

Culot et al. 2018. Atlantic-Primates: a dataset of communities and occurrences of primates in the Atlantic forests of South America. Ecology. 

### The datapaper was ACCEPTED in ECOLOGY journal, and will be out in September/2018

Here, we compiled a dataset of 4678 georeferenced locations of 26 native and 1 introduced primate species, as well as hybrids within each genera of Callithrix and Alouatta. The dataset includes 630 primate communities, 7,368 single species occurrences and 349 estimates of primate population sizes, covering most natural forest types of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Forest of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. On average, primate communities of the Atlantic Forest harbor 2±1 species (range=1-6). However, about 41% of primate communities contain only one species. The most common species are Alouatta guariba (N=2,169 records) and Sapajus nigritus (N=990). The least common species are Leontopithecus caissara (N=34), Sapajus flavius (N=44), and Callicebus barbarabrownae (N=46). Primate density varies from 0.00438 individuals/km² (Alouatta guariba at Fragmento do Bugre, Paraná, Brazil) to 240 individuals/km² (Callithrix penicillata at Mata Joaquim Egidio, Sao Paulo, Brazil). Our dataset reflects disparity between the numerous primate census conducted in the Atlantic Forest, in contrast to the scarcity of estimates of population sizes and densities.

**The original dataset is fully available at ECOLOGY repository**.
